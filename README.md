- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlainJulien
- 👀 As an avid coffee drinker, I think the gym is a good place to burn off extra energy(if anyone has that anymore) and a nice place to get your mental right.
- I also enjoy reading and the continuous learning into Data Analytics.

- 🌱 I took up the path of Data Analytics after my last job where I was asked to create and evaluation tool which when I began researching, I forgot that SQL 
and Excel were actually powerful tools and I found Data Analytics and ever since then I haven't turned back on trying to learn the field.

- 📫 I can reached at alain_j@live.com and any feedback on how to go about projects or just improving in the field is always welcomed.

- Update: I landed a job as Business Systems Analyst in the public sector of my country and now I am shifting my focus a bit again to BI Engineering..wish me luck
